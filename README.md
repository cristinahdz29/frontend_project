<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

We created this site and app in order to provide users with a more efficient way of finding public bathrooms near them. We tried to make this an inclusive project and thanks to the api we are able to provide users with multiple resources about the public restooms. 

Why an app such as this can be helpfull:
* In some areas it can be difficult to know where the closest restrooms are, especially if you're a tourist or are not used to the area.
* The information provided can be helpful in finding out if the closest restrooms are accessible to the disabled, have changing stations, or are unisex bathrooms.
* This will be especially helful for travellers and will allow people from all walks of life to find accessible bathrooms.


### Built With
